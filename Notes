Cool — if the goal is **“users love it” + “Apple notices”**, you want Ada to feel like it was *born inside iOS*: **on-device intelligence, deep App Intents integration everywhere, privacy-forward, and shockingly useful in 30 seconds.** Apple has explicitly positioned this direction with the **Foundation Models framework** (on-device Apple Intelligence model) and its “integrate everywhere” approach via **App Intents**. ([Apple Developer][1])

Below is a build plan you can hand straight to Claude Code.

---

## The “Apple attention” thesis

Apple will care if Ada:

1. **Uses Foundation Models correctly** (task model, not a generic chatbot) ([Apple Machine Learning Research][2])
2. **Feels system-native**: Spotlight + Shortcuts + widgets + Siri phrases + Visual Intelligence entry points (via App Intents) ([Apple Developer][3])
3. **Is privacy-credible**: on-device by default; clear consent; minimal collection; App Store privacy details aligned ([Apple Developer][4])
4. **Delivers a “wow loop”**: user says something messy → Ada produces a clean plan + executes + shows “what changed” (audit trail)

---

## The killer product: “Ada: Personal Ops + Capture”

### What users will love (and use daily)

**Ada is the fastest way to turn life into structured action**, with two headline features:

### 1) “One Message to Organized”

User drops a blob like:

> “Dentist next Thursday afternoon, remind me the night before, and schedule a follow-up in 6 months. Also add a packing list for Dallas.”

Ada returns:

* created calendar event + reminder
* a checklist in Ada
* optional “shareable” summary

**All execution uses first-party frameworks** (Calendar/Reminders) and is exposed via App Intents so it runs from Shortcuts/Spotlight/Siri. ([Apple Developer][3])

### 2) “Scan → Structure” (Capture that compiles)

Point camera at:

* class notes / whiteboard
* a bill
* a flyer
* a schedule

Ada does OCR + structure:

* tasks
* dates
* contacts
* action items
* a “clean doc” output

This is the kind of practical “Apple Intelligence” use Apple promotes: summarization, extraction, refinement — not trivia. ([Apple Machine Learning Research][2])

---

## System design (the Ada loop)

### A. On-device planning (Foundation Models)

Use Foundation Models framework to produce a typed object:

**Plan**

* `intent`: string
* `entities`: dates, times, locations, people, amounts
* `actions`: list of tool calls to run (calendar/reminders/checklists)
* `confirmations`: what must be confirmed before execution
* `risk`: “none / needs confirm / sensitive”

Apple’s own research notes this model is best for tasks like summarization/extraction/refinement, not broad world knowledge. ([Apple Machine Learning Research][2])

### B. Tool execution (App Intents-first)

Everything “do-able” is implemented as App Intents:

* `CreateEventIntent`
* `CreateReminderIntent`
* `CreateChecklistIntent`
* `ScanAndExtractIntent`
* `DailyBriefIntent`
* `FocusModePrepIntent` (if you integrate Focus data later)

App Intents are the official integration surface for **Shortcuts, Spotlight, widgets, and system experiences**. ([Apple Developer][3])

### C. Verification + receipts (Apple will like this)

After executing each action:

* read back the created/updated object
* show a “receipt”:

  * ✅ event created (title/time/location)
  * ✅ reminder created (due date)
  * ✅ list created (items)
* keep a local audit log (“Ada Ledger”) that the user can export

This makes Ada feel *trustworthy*.

## The “everywhere” entry points (non-negotiable)

If you want Apple’s attention, Ada must show up across iOS:

1. **Spotlight**: “Create reminder with Ada”, “Scan with Ada” (App Intents + App Shortcuts) ([Apple Developer][3])
2. **Shortcuts**: rich parameters + suggested shortcuts ([Apple Developer][3])
3. **Widgets**: quick actions (Scan / Add / Brief)
4. **Share Sheet**: “Send to Ada” (summarize, extract tasks/dates)
5. **Action Button / Lock Screen** quick capture (if supported by your targets)

---

## Privacy posture (must be crisp)

Your marketing line should basically be Apple’s line:

* **On-device processing by default**
* Clear consent for Calendar/Reminders/Photos access
* No silent collection
* If anything goes off-device, make it user-initiated and obvious

Apple’s guidance emphasizes processing on device where possible, and App Store privacy disclosures treat on-device-only processing differently than collected data. ([Apple Developer][5])

## What to hand Claude Code (build spec checklist)

### 1) App structure

* SwiftUI app
* Modules:

  * `AdaCore` (types, plan schema, audit log)
  * `AdaModels` (Foundation Models wrapper)
  * `AdaTools` (App Intents implementations)
  * `AdaUI` (chat + receipts + capture)

### 2) Data model (local-first)

* `AdaItem` (task/event/note)
* `AdaPlan`
* `AdaReceipt`
* `AdaLedgerEntry` (timestamp, input hash, actions, results)

### 3) App Intents (initial set)

* Create Reminder
* Create Event
* Scan & Extract (camera → OCR → plan)
* Daily Brief (summarize today + top tasks)
* “Inbox to Plan” (paste text → plan)

### 4) Core screens

* **Chat** (input + receipts)
* **Inbox** (captured items awaiting approval)
* **Ledger** (what Ada changed)
* **Automations** (saved routines as Shortcuts)

### 5) “Wow” demo script (for Apple / users)

* “Here’s a messy paragraph.” → Ada outputs a clean plan → executes → shows receipts → user taps “Save as Shortcut”

This demo aligns perfectly with how Apple describes developer access to on-device intelligence and system-wide integrations. ([apple.com][6])

---

## Optional “Apple flex” features (v2)

These are *exactly* the kinds of things that get featured:

* **Context window discipline** (use Apple’s guidance on managing context) ([Apple Developer][7])
* **Personal writing styles**: rewrite text in “my tone” (all on-device)
* **Visual Intelligence hook**: “Recognize this schedule → add events” (build with the same intent architecture)

---

## The one decision that matters

To maximize love + Apple attention:

**Make Ada a “compiler for life”:**

* input is messy human stuff
* output is structured, verified actions
* Ada never pretends it did something it didn’t
* Ada shows receipts

If you want, paste the exact line you want Ada to be known for (your slogan), and I’ll turn this into:

* a full PRD,
* an App Intents catalog (with parameter schemas),
* and a Claude Code “build prompt” that generates the project skeleton in one go.
